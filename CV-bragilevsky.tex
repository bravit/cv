% \section{Master thesis}
% \cvline{title}{\emph{Singular-type operators in the spaces of vector-valued functions.}}
% \cvline{supervisor}{Prof. V.S. Pilidi}
% \cvline{description}{\small Algebras of operators of singular and bisingular type are considered. For these algebras, 
% the notions of an envelope of a family of operators are introduced, 
% necessary and sufficient conditions of its existence and uniqueness are given. 
% There are obtained estimates for the essential norm of the envelope operator. 
% The statements of the paper are demonstrated for the case of singular integral 
% operators with continuous operator-valued coefficients.}
